#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It involves using structured processes, tools, and techniques to ensure that software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and meets user requirements, all while managing complexity and minimizing risks throughout the software development lifecycle.

Importance of software engineering in technology industry:
Software Engineering enables the creation of softwares that are used to power various aspect of Life which includes communication, entertainment, trnsportation, health, commerce, etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s)
Overview: In the early days of computing, software development was chaotic, with code often written in a "spaghetti" fashion—unstructured and difficult to maintain or understand. The introduction of structured programming in the 1960s was a major turning point.
Key Figures: Edsger Dijkstra was a prominent advocate for structured programming, promoting the idea that software should be written with a clear, logical structure, using constructs like loops, conditionals, and subroutines.
Impact: This approach led to the development of more reliable, maintainable, and understandable code, laying the foundation for modern programming languages like C, which emphasize structured programming principles.
2. The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s)
Overview: As software systems grew more complex, there was a need for a new paradigm to manage this complexity. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged in the 1980s as a solution, introducing the concept of objects—self-contained entities that combine data and behavior.
Key Figures: The development of OOP is largely attributed to Alan Kay, who developed Smalltalk, one of the first OOP languages, and to Bjarne Stroustrup, who created C++, which brought OOP into mainstream use.
Impact: OOP revolutionized software design by enabling modularity, reusability, and more natural mapping to real-world concepts. This paradigm became the standard for software development, influencing many languages like Java, Python, and C#.
3. The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001)
Overview: Traditional software development methodologies like the Waterfall model were often rigid and slow to adapt to changing requirements. In response, the Agile Manifesto was published in 2001, promoting a more flexible and iterative approach to software development.
Key Figures: The Agile Manifesto was authored by 17 software practitioners, including notable figures like Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, and Robert C. Martin.
Impact: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasize collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental delivery. This shift has dramatically improved the ability of teams to respond to change, deliver value more quickly, and improve software quality, making Agile the dominant methodology in the industry today.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: THis is the state of fathering and documenting the user needs
2. Design: This is the state of creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
3. Imlementation: This is the state of writing codes and buiding of the software.
4. Testing: This is the state of testing and debugging the software to meet quality standard


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases (eg. requirements, design, implementation...), flowing down like waterfall
- Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, colaboration and responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing codes, testing and debugging the software
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for testing and debugging the software. He ensures qsoftware quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project Manager: Responsible for managing the project. He oversee the project, execution and delivery of the software


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) enhance productivity and code quality by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and project management features within a single platform (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA). Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git and Subversion enable collaboration, track code changes, and manage project history, ensuring efficient teamwork and the integrity of the codebase.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing environment
- Tight deadlines
- Learning new technologies
- Technical department


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components in isolation to catch bugs early and ensure correct functionality.
2. Integration Testing: Verifies that combined modules work together correctly, ensuring seamless interaction.
3. System Testing: Evaluates the complete software to ensure it meets specified requirements and functions properly as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Validates that the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery to end-users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the act of giving the right instruction to a robot(AI). It is crucial because well-designed prompts can significantly improve the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the AI's responses, making interactions more efficient and aligned with specific goals or tasks.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about animals."

Improved Prompt:
"Provide a detailed overview of the characteristics, habitat, and diet of African elephants."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly specifies the animal in question (African elephants) and the specific details to be covered (characteristics, habitat, diet). This guidance helps the AI focus its response on relevant information, leading to a more accurate and useful answer. The clarity and specificity also reduce ambiguity, ensuring the response meets the user’s exact needs.
